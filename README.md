# Machine Learning - A hands on approach

This Showcase is inspired by the assignments of the course "Machine Learning" which I attend this summer semester 2020. The module does not only show implementations of different learning models, but also teaches the underlying mathematical foundations. In the following, a problem will be presented and how we can solve it, including the model selection, parameter tuning and finally, the model evaluation. 
<br><br/>
The work on these tasks has been a close collaboration with @iwasscience. While I polished the nuances to make this showcase presentable, we worked together to solve the assignments. If you're further interested in other Machine Learning Projects, I truly recommend you to check out his [GitHub](https://github.com/iwasscience).

## Overview
To start with, a description of our primary learning problem is given. This learning problem will serve as our motivation and guide us along the sections. Every section itself consists of the implementation and the theory behind it. Our elaboration is structured as the following: 
<br>

1. The dataset

2. Learning Model

3. Hyperparameter Tuning

4. Model Evaluation
