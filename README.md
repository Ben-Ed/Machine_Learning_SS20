# Machine_Learning_SS20
Learning Models, hyperparameter optimization and model evaluation - A hands on showcase

This Showcase is inspired by the assignments of the course "Machine Learning" which I attend this summer semester 2020. The module does not only show implementations of different learning models, but also teaches the underlying mathematical foundations. In the following, a problem will be presented and how we can solve it, including the model selection, parameter tuning and finally, the model evaluation.

The work on these tasks has been a close collaboration with @iwasscience. While I polished the nuances to make this showcase presentable, we worked together to solve the assignments. If you're further interested in other Machine Learning Projects, I truly recommend you to check out his [GitHub](https://github.com/iwasscience).
